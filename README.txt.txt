Explore US Bikeshare Data

This interactive project uses Python to explore data related to the bike share systems for three major US cities - Chicago, New York City, and Washigton.

The project uses Python and Python packages (time, pandas, and numpy) to create an interactive interface where users can input their preferences to filter the data by city and month and obtain information about the following data points:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
